# Exercise 2: Inheritance and Method Overriding

Define a base class called Animal with a method make_sound that prints a generic animal sound.
Create derived classes such as Dog, Cat, and Cow that inherit from Animal and override the make_sound method with specific sounds for each animal.
Instantiate instances of each animal class and call the make_sound method to hear their respective sounds.
