# Exercise 3: Class and Instance Methods

Define a class called Circle with an attribute radius.
Implement a method called calculate_area that calculates and returns the area of the circle using the formula area = Ï€ * radius^2.
Implement an instance method called change_radius that allows modifying the radius attribute of a circle.
Create instances of the Circle class and demonstrate the usage of both the calculate_area and change_radius methods.
