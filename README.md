# OOP Practice
This directory was created to provide example problems that progressively get harder to help with thinking in an Object Oriented mindset. Many of these problems are slightly adjusted from ChatGPT or directly taken from problems solved in CodePlatoon's FoP(Foundation's of Programming) course.

# Instructions
Each exercise will be in a separate markdown document similar to this README (ex: challenge1.md, challenge2.md, etc..) The starter file main.py is intended for use as a 'sandbox' to practice creating and accessing classes created. You should create your own python file for each exercise as well as an additional file for your testing. The file main_test.py includes some notes for basic unit testing.

# Beginning:
The first problem will be solved and include notes/comments of things I have learned so far. If you have additional comments or find anything unclear be sure to let me know and I will update them.


Starter Notes Example: (main.py main_test.py)
Create a class Person that will have attributes such as 'name' and 'age' when instantiated. Then create a method for class Person that returns a greeting string when called. Make at least 3 instances of the Person class, and prove that your greet method properly works. (Hint: spec test/ unit test)

If you already fully understand everything in main.py and main_test.py, then feel free to delete the code and use them for working on any of the challenges.
