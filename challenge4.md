# Exercise 4: Inheritance and Method Overriding

Define a base class called Shape with an attribute color.
Implement a method called get_color that returns the color of the shape.
Create derived classes such as Rectangle and Circle that inherit from the Shape class.
Override the get_color method in each derived class to provide specific behavior for retrieving the color of the respective shape.
Instantiate instances of the derived classes and demonstrate the usage of the get_color method.
